## Week 1

A challenge I have encountered this week was understanding basic code and reviewing outcomes when using different integers as the input. One action that helped a lot was going through as a class, step by step, how the code would be executed. Having done some learning on python externally out of lectures I have become a lot more competent. This has allowed me to progress not only reading and understanding blocks of code but actually writing simple programs myself using a varied amount of functions. I feel as if I could have had a better understanding of following lectures by extending my knowledge even before I started the course itself. 

Following this I have set myself the goal of continuing to learn python through the use of online tutorials and actual self-practise on a regular basis until we transfer to C++. I can measure this goal through the amount of time I have spent learning Python and by how many tutorials I have gone through.


## Week 2 

This week we have as a class been introduced to many new programs and features some of us have never used before. I have found this challenging in the fact I have to catch up in multiple areas but with a little concentration and hard work I don’t think I will be too difficult. One that I am not too keen on is PyGame however this is probably to lack of use. 

To become more competent, I think I should complete more external work and projects that are more personal to learn at least the basics. This will both be fun while learning. I can also learn from my lecturers, other students and internet sources if I need help. I have already found the PyGame site offers huge help with example on how to use each function. Therefore, catching up here shouldn’t be too difficult if I am willing to put in a bit of extra work outside the classroom. Setting myself the goal of completing a personal project in software I am not comfortable with is a great way to help myself become more used to using it when it comes into assignments. Measuring this will be easy and whether it has made any difference can be easily shown too by the quality of the work produced.
