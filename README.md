# comp150-cpd

# Semester 2 
 
## Week 1

First week back
practise over holidays 
more pluralsight 
slight experience with previous unreal/game engines helps

## Week 2 

Transition to C++
these worksheets really help although can be difficult 
rather than being stuck use my multiple sources of help effectively since there is massive support (guild, supervised studio practise, pull request, slack)

## Week 3

Being introduced to many different industry based practices in the comp 160 lectures has been a bit of a struggle to understand personally.
Reviwing lesson slides next day and further research, FE YT tutorials

## Week 4 

One in particular challenge I have found diificult to deal with is the lack of communication in group work. This has both affected the groups efficiency in working and overall morale which I believe both impact one another anyway. Although it is hard to contact one another if people are not there in person, we are trying to arrange daily stand ups. This gives me, and I hope, my team more motivation when you understand what other members of the group are currently working on.
