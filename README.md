## Week 1

A challenge I have encountered this week was understanding basic code and reviewing outcomes when using different integers as the input. One action that helped a lot was going through as a class, step by step, how the code would be executed. Having done some learning on python externally out of lectures I have become a lot more competent. This has allowed me to progress not only reading and understanding blocks of code but actually writing simple programs myself using a varied amount of functions. I feel as if I could have had a better understanding of following lectures by extending my knowledge even before I started the course itself. 

Following this I have set myself the goal of continuing to learn python through the use of online tutorials and actual self-practise on a regular basis until we transfer to C++. I can measure this goal through the amount of time I have spent learning Python and by how many tutorials I have gone through.
