## Week 1

A challenge I have encountered this week was understanding basic code and reviewing outcomes when using different integers as the input. One action that helped a lot was going through as a class, step by step, how the code would be executed. Having done some learning on python externally out of lectures I have become a lot more competent. This has allowed me to progress not only reading and understanding blocks of code but actually writing simple programs myself using a varied amount of functions. I feel as if I could have had a better understanding of following lectures by extending my knowledge even before I started the course itself. 

Following this I have set myself the goal of continuing to learn python through the use of online tutorials and actual self-practise on a regular basis until we transfer to C++. I can measure this goal through the amount of time I have spent learning Python and by how many tutorials I have gone through.


## Week 2 

This week we have as a class been introduced to many new programs and features some of us have never used before. I have found this challenging in the fact I have to catch up in multiple areas but with a little concentration and hard work I don’t think I will be too difficult. One that I am not too keen on is PyGame however this is probably to lack of use. 

To become more competent, I think I should complete more external work and projects that are more personal to learn at least the basics. This will both be fun while learning. I can also learn from my lecturers, other students and internet sources if I need help. I have already found the PyGame site offers huge help with example on how to use each function. Therefore, catching up here shouldn’t be too difficult if I am willing to put in a bit of extra work outside the classroom. Setting myself the goal of completing a personal project in software I am not comfortable with is a great way to help myself become more used to using it when it comes into assignments. Measuring this will be easy and whether it has made any difference can be easily shown too by the quality of the work produced. 

## Week 3 

Without a doubt being introduced to algorithm conmplexities during Ed Powley's lessons have been the most challenging as i have no previous knowledge of anything relevant to this. A prime example for this was Worksheet C that we were set as a task to do outside of class. I felt like this was very hard but now i realise that it is not as hard as i thought. At first i tried to tackle these equations on my own which didnt go too well, but managing to complete some of it on my own. At this point I discussed it with some of my peers which helped a small amount. Having now gone through the answer in lecture and explained how each works it is a lot clearer. I think in the future I should definitely go over the session slides out of lesson as this seems to be the most useful resource, however I did not make use of it. I am planning to do this in the future as they are easy to access and especially use for worksheet assignements if confused again. 

## Week 4

Here we are four weeks in  and I have come across another problem which I have tackled. Today we were introduced to data structures involving arrays and lists. during lecture i found it difficult to comphrehend all of these at once. Since the lecture I have gone over the powerpoint slides again and researched the parts i didnt understand so well. At the time i hadnt used a dictionary list however now going over it outside of class i have included it in part of my other work which I think is proof that going over parts of lecture is beneficial (especially the parts you struggle with). I found this has really helped me understand fully now. For a SMART target I would like to carry out. This being to go over the lecture slides after lecture within i few days. I think that it will be highly beneficial to not just go over something new once and expect to learn it but having that second look will help me understand more. 

## Week 5 

Self motivation
I find myself this week amongst many assignments and presentations in progress all at once. Currently I have six upcoming hand in dates for various work covering all three modules of the course. Although I have much work to do I have found it hard to motivate myself to get work done and have therefore set myself a target over the coming weeks. I want to set myself smaller deadlines for parts of each assignment. This will lead to me progressively getting work completed rather than doing considerable amount of work near deadlines. This is especially important due to the deadlines being so close together. 

## Week 6
Preparation



## Week 7

Regular practise

## Week 8 

Group work
This week group work has been a main focus withmultiple projects involving teams from two to twelve persons. I find the two person pair programming assignments beneficial and achievable however the larger group ones not so much due to less control of what is going on. 

## Week 9

Time management
